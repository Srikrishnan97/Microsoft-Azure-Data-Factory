# Recruitment Analytics

Powerful recruiting metrics helps you explore every aspect of your business, turn data into actionable insights, and make better recruiting decisions faster. 

Recruitment analytics is a process of using data-driven metrics and insights to improve the sourcing of the best candidates for different roles within your organization that will help you cut costs and better understand factors that are influencing your hiring process.

By leveraging the power of recruitment analytics to your advantage and working with interactive visual dashboards, you’ll be able to streamline your talent acquisition efforts in a number of key areas, including vacancy fill times, application reviews, talent screening and shortlisting, and hire value or accuracy – among many others.

The below are the actionable insights we try to pull out using the data.

  - How long does it take to hire employees?
  - How much money are you spending on the entire hiring process?
  - what is the recruitment conversion rate for each hr?
  - how does the recruiting funnel looks like?
  - Which places are the candidates looking for your job postings?
  - Does the job description that you provided accurately matches the applicant?
  - what is the turn over rate by age group?
  - what is the offer acceptance rate?
  - what is the % of open positions?
